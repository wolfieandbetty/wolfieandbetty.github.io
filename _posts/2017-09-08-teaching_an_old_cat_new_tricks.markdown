Lots of people find it odd that at the age of 60 I am attending a Coding Bootcamp. Most friends my age are talking about retirement or have already moved into that stage of life. They're happy to be putting their working life behind them, slowing down, and enjoying a more relaxed lifestyle.  But I was born with Maker DNA. I am insanely curious and seriously worry about not having enough time on the Planet to explore and try all the fascinating things that I'm interested in. And that list of things grows as I head down the rabbit hole in any of the subjects that I'm studying as there is always another branch so to speak, that has it's own trail of intrigue and depth that in itself is all consuming.

I have a 41 year career history in Tech. When I was almost 19 years old and had left high school I was faced with what to do next. I came from a working class family at a time when the expectation was that I would get a secretarial job, get married and have children. My parents never gave me any hope or engaged in discussion about College. I lived in the SF Bay area when Silicon Valley was very new and there were more jobs to fill than people to fill them. You could literally walk into the lobby of a company, ask if they were hiring and have a job within a couple of hours. And that's what I did. It is exactly how I managed to start what would become a wildly successful and well paying profession for decades. When I was 20 I found myself working for a CAD/CAM software company and applied for a position as a Technical Trainer (my previous position was as a user of their software). I got the job and was soon traveling around the world teaching our customers how to use this very complex software product. I spent all my time at work and into the wee hours learning every aspect of the software and at age 23 I was offered a position in London as a System Engineer and then as a Technical Manager managing a team of 5 System Engineers.

I moved to London, and spent 6 years traveling around Europe teaching the CAD/CAM product as well as 2 programming languages that I was using in conjunction with our software: Fortran and a language that was derived from IBM's APL called GPL. It was the most fulfilling time in my entire career. I loved learning and I loved teaching and programming taught me to think in a very disciplined and methodical way that has helped me in every job I've had since. 

At 28 I went to University and obtained a Bachelor's in Business because by that time I'd moved from a technical role to Sales. I had a very successful Sales career and again - I attribute it to having a solid technical foundation and knowing how to help customer's problem solve in a way that made them successful and made me alot of money.

So here I am MANY years later and when I thought about what was next for my life it was a no brainer. I want to learn new tools and build cool stuff. I'm a long way away from the Lazy Boy and a remote and am so excited to be here!
